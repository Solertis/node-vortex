This example demonstrates how to configure and run docker.

To run the example simply execute the following from your shell:

	cd path/to/vortex/git/doc/examples/docker-helloworld
	vortex boot
	vortex provision
	vortex shell

There is no need to provision the machine since we are using a custom image designed to run docker natively.
