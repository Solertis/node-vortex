This example demonstrates how to expose files inside the virtualized containers.

To run the example simply execute the following from your shell:

	cd path/to/vortex/git/doc/examples/expose-fles
	vortex up

This will expose all locals files and print document.txt.

The same setup can be deployed in other providers besides VirtualBox. To use Amazon you will have to provide additional configuration options.
