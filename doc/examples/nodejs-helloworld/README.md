This example demonstrates how to configure and run a nodejs application with the express framework. The application runs on its own and does not require database and other forms of data storage.

To run the example simply execute the following from your shell:

	cd path/to/vortex/git/doc/examples/nodejs-helloworld
	vortex boot
	vortex provision

The same setup can be deployed in other providers besides VirtualBox. To use Amazon you will have to provide additional configuration options.
